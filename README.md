objectives: use IIFE and module patterns 

## CLI Game Mode
- run ```ts-node-esm ./src/cli-game.ts```
<!-- - for big n games ```NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=8192' ts-node-esm cli-game.ts``` might be required ??? -->

## Test's
- run ```npm run test-board```

## to-do

- must refactor all the state transfer logic to just checking current full3Dboard and pass states as an array, i think
